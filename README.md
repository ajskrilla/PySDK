# PySDK

This is for the Centrify PAS REST API Python Module. This is a rough draft and will change often.

A Centrify Oauth2 Client is required and is used for all authentication in the module. One has to be set up, have a valid scope, and rights. 

You will have to run the ConfigF.py function and make the configuration file for which the classes us to make calls.

Currently, there are only 4 modules:

1. ConfigF.py
2. PAS_Utility
3. PAS_Report
4. PAS_Secret_Management

There is an example on how to use the classes and functions for the 3 PAS modules. 

They will be updated and the updates will be posted as they are added. 

Need to install 3 Python packages on the system (requests, pandas, ConfigParser). Will have an install file for Linux.
